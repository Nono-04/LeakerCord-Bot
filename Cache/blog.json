Here\u2019s how to snag your savings.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nPC and Console Savings</h2>\n\n<p>Starting today, any V-Bucks or real-money offers you purchase on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac are now discounted by up to 20%. You don\u2019t need to do anything!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nEpic direct payment on Mobile</h2>\n\n<p>Today, we\u2019re also introducing a new way to pay on iOS and Android: Epic direct payment. When you choose to use Epic direct payments, you save up to 20% as Epic passes along payment processing savings to you.<br />\n<br />\nGrab the latest Fortnite update to begin saving today! Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Epic direct pay on Apple App Store\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-direct-pay-apple-app-store-2045x979-730033169.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Epic direct pay on Google Play Store\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-direct-pay-google-play-store-2045x979-730031947.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Choose Epic direct payment to get the best deal on V-Bucks and real-money purchases.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nCurrently, when using Apple and Google payment options, Apple and Google collect a 30% fee, and the up to 20% price drop does not apply.
